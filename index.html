        >Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares. Safe squares contain numbers telling you
            how many mines touch each square. You can use the number clues to solve the game by opening the safe
            squares. If you click on a mine you lose the game.

            Windows Minesweeper always makes the first click safe. You open squares with the left mouse button and put
            flags on mines with the right mouse button. Pressing the right mouse button again puts a questionmark on the
            square. When you open a square that does not touch a mine, the square will be empty and nearby squares will
            open in all directions until squares contain numbers. A common strategy for starting games is to randomly
            click until you get a big opening with lots of numbers.

            Chording is when you press both mouse buttons at the same time. If you flag all mines touching a number,
            chording on the number opens the remaining squares. This can save you a lot of work! However, if you place
            the correct number of flags on the wrong squares, chording will explode the mines.

            The three difficulty levels are Beginner (8x8 or 9x9 with 10 mines), Intermediate (16x16 with 40 mines) and
            Expert (30x16 with 99 mines). The game ends when all safe squares have been opened. A counter shows the
            number of unflagged mines and a clock shows your time in seconds. Minesweeper saves your best time for each
            difficulty level.</li>
